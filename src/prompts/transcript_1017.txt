 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Thank you. All right. Okay. Thank you. These are for chapter 12, which some of you picked up last class, but if you don't already have them, they are here. You don't have them, you need them. Yeah. Yeah. so so oh Thank you. All right. All right. So today we are going to start the next section of the course. So the first course really divided into roughly three parts. The first part is sort of externalities and public goods. We covered that in chapters five through 11. Now the next part will be social insurance and redistribution. which we'll cover in chapters 12 through 17. And then finally, we'll talk about taxation in the last section of the course, from chapters 18 to 25. Now, having a whole section on social insurance is a relatively new innovation in the field of public finance. When I taught public finance, there was one chapter on social insurance. When I took public finance, there was one chapter on the field of social insurance. But that was clearly out of time, out of step. In 1953, so if you look at figure 12-1, in 1953, which is not long before a lot of my teachers were educated, most of what the government does was defense, was providing a public good. And that's why that was a major emphasis in most public finance texts. but by the time I came along and was thinking about writing my own public textbook, it looked more like 2019, where most of what the government does is provide healthcare, social security, and other functions, a lot of which are also might be called social insurance. So the world has really changed. As Paul Krugman famously said, the U.S. government can now be thought of as a large pension fund that happens to have an army on the side. So basically, we are really a very different kind of government than we were for most of our nation's history, actually. And that means we pay a lot more attention to most of what the government does, which is actually social insurance. So what is social insurance? That's our first topic today. Social insurance is basically government-provided insurance against adverse events. So social insurance is government-provided insurance against adverse events. We will talk in this course about a variety of the largest social insurance programs in the country. The largest single social insurance program in the country is Social Security. That's the largest single. Hot on its heels is Medicare, which is, so Social Security, I'll talk about these programs in more detail, but just to roughly give ideas, Social Security is money that is a program that ensures you against retirement or disability. Medicare is a program that insures you against ill health. There's, of course, we all are favored from the pandemic, unemployment insurance, which insures you against job loss. There's disability insurance, which insures you against a career-ending disability. And then there's workers' compensation, which insures you against an on-the-job accident. Okay? All of these feature programs have a similar structure, which is basically you participate by working. The programs are mandatory for all workers. So they're mandatory programs that are financed out of salary. So essentially, anybody who works, by definition, has to participate in these programs. and they're financed by reductions, either taxes that your employer pays or you pay or both. So financed by taxes or by insurance payments that are mandatory. And so that's the first feature. The second feature is they're typically not means tested. What I mean by that is they're not dependent on your income. Bill Gates gets social security just like I get social security, just like a janitor when they retire from Social Security. These are not means-tested programs. They can be progressive in their features, and I'll talk about that, but they are not means-tested. This is not redistributive welfare, which we'll talk about in about five lectures. These are social insurance. They're universal entitlements that you qualify for by working and paying your contributions. And finally, the last feature, so they're universal entitlements. They're not means-tested. and they're basically programs which are payouts are triggered by adverse events so social security payouts are triggered by retirement or disability unemployment insurance is triggered by losing your job workers comp it's triggered by being injured on the job okay and these programs will raise the a fundamental trade-off that will cover this which is a trade-off between on the one hand fixing failures in insurance markets remember this course is all about the why. Question, why do we need government? Well, because insurance markets are rife with failures. On the other hand, in fixing those failures, they'll create a new problem we call moral hazard, which is a problem that when you insure an adverse event, you encourage that adverse event. So today, we're going to sort of lay out the fundamental basics. Remember I said in this course, we sort of have for each section, like a basic theory lecture and then applications. So we have a basic theory lecture for social insurance. Then in chapter 13, 14, 15, 16, we'll apply that theory to different programs. First in chapter 13, we'll talk about social security. In chapter 14, we'll talk about these three programs. And chapter 15 and 16, we'll talk about healthcare, including Medicare. Okay, so essentially, this lays out the basic framework that if you understand it, we're just going to apply that framework in the next few lectures. So this is a particularly important lecture in order to sort of understand that pretty well. Okay. Now, so what I want to do is talk about, I want to start with the basis of insurance demand. And this should be our view of Fortune 01, at least if anyone took it with me, which is the basics of expected utility theory. So I'm just going to review the basics of expected utility theory, which drives insurance demand. Let's begin by reviewing how insurance works. So how does insurance work? Insurance works by individuals paying a regular premium, monthly or semi-annually or annually or weekly, whatever it is. You pay a regular premium that's unconditional in return for which if you meet a certain set of qualifications, you then receive reimbursement for your medical care or other care, not medical care, any kind of care. So basically, the idea of insurance is basically you pay up front, you get reimbursed for the care you need. should the adverse event happens. And this is big business. Okay. So right now, for example, health insurance in the U.S. is about $1.1 trillion every year spent on health insurance premiums. There's about $250 billion every year on auto insurance, about $160 billion a year on life insurance, and about $700 billion a year on property and casualty insurance. I'm sure your home against fire or theft. So add those up. We're at something like $2.5 trillion a year, on the order of 10% of GDP. So that is a lot of money that's going to people buying insurance. First question is, why do people want insurance? How do we model that? And then we'll ask, what causes failures in the market for insurance? So to understand the principle of insurance, really we just have i'll do the math in a minute but the intuition is we just think about individuals facing different possible states of the world so now we're thinking about instead of a model with period a and period b it's a model with it's like a science fiction model this could happen or this could happen the certain states of the world and you're thinking about those future states of the world and you've got to ask yourself what do i want to do today given the two possible future states of the world that I could face. And the answer is going to be, bluntly, given diminishing margin utility, your goal is going to be to maximally smooth consumption. Remember what diminishing margin utility says. Remember we learned that in 14.01. Diminishing margin utility says that I am much happier eating the same thing every day than I am partying one day and starving the next. I would much rather smooth because of the curvature of the utility function, because of because of diminishing margin utility i would much rather have a smoother path of consumption than a jagged path of consumption because the ups make me less happy than the downs make me sad we're not going to put it as log of zero is negative infinity we typically use log utility functions that means if you get to zero you're there's nothing that can make you as happy as getting a zero makes you sad okay so basically because diminishing margin utility of a lot of the typical kind of log form we use you're going to want a smooth consumption. You want to try to endeavor to try to keep your consumption as constant as possible. What insurance does is essentially give you a mechanism for ensuring that regardless of the future state of the world, your consumption is smoothed. So that's the benefit of insurance. We talk about today with the benefits and costs of insurance. The fundamental benefit of insurance is consumption smoothing. The fundamental benefit of insurance is making sure that however the world shakes out, you don't end up starving, which is what you're really, really afraid of. Okay. So let's think about, let's go back to our basic, we go back to 1401. Let's go back to our basic expected utility model in 1401. Let me remind you how such a model works. Okay. Let's say that the only risk you face, you're here in Cambridge, there's a regularly high risk getting hit by a car, but let's say otherwise you're healthy. So the only risk you face is getting be hit by a car. And let's face you're hit by a car with some probability P. So you have a probability P of getting hit by a car. Okay. Let's say your income is W. And let's say that that income is earned whether you get hit or not. You don't miss work. Okay. So we're going to take the work risk out of this. It's just the healthcare risk. Okay. But if you do get hit, you incur medical cost delta you incur medical cost delta let me just mention by the way usually the problems that's only covered last week's material this problem set will actually cover today's lecture so that's why i'm doing the math and the tas will be have extra office hours to help you i should also say that whoever can come up with the best adjective for hannah's cat gets an extra point on today on this week's problem set right your cat's still on there dog and midterm dog and midterm oh sorry about that oh well the dogs in the midterm really screwed that up didn't i okay well in the midterm whatever comes up the best action for hannah's dog it's an extra point okay so sorry about that i'm i just i'm never as clever as i think i am okay so basically um let me go back so basically but the general point i'm making is that um the general point i'm making is that the material i'm teaching today you'll need to know for the problems I just explained. Okay. So you can buy insurance, you can buy insurance with a premium M, a premium M for buying insurance. And that's the amount of premium you pay per dollar. So in other words, M of 0.01 means I pay one penny per dollar of insurance. M of one would be, I pay a dollar for every dollar of insurance. So M is premium per dollar. And then if you get hit by the car, B is the payout. So if you get hit by a car, you get a payout B. Okay? That's the basics of the problem. Okay? So in this case, we can write your expected utility. respect utility is just the utility from today from for tomorrow from the perspective of today given that there's uncertainty about tomorrow your expect utility for tomorrow is there's a one minus p chance one minus p chance that you don't get hit in which case your expect utility is U of W, which is your income, minus, if you don't get hit, W of your income minus MB. That's your insurance premium. So if you don't buy insurance, it's zero. It's M per dollar, and B is the number of dollars you're insuring. Or you can get hit. So it's probably P times utility, if you still get W, you still pay MB, you now have to pay delta. You now have to pay delta, but you get paid back B. That is your utility if you get it in the state that you do get it. You still have W minus MB. You still have to pay your insurance premium to make your earnings. The other reason is I have to pay a medical bill delta, but you get a check from the insurance company for for B okay questions about that yeah what is u here utility this is an expect utility function like the u in one minus u times u times something yeah this is your utility you just like the tilde square root of square it's a function okay so basically that's the setup we're going to make one other assumption here in the model which is we're going to assume that insurance is actuarially fair. Actuarially fair insurance means zero profits. Zero profits means that basically, I'm sorry, zero expected profits. I'll be clear. And what are expected profits for an insurance company when they sell insurance in this market? Well, expected profits are, they collect in premiums M times B. That's how much premiums they collect. What do they pay out? They pay out P times B. With a probability of P, they pay out B. Okay? So the expected, the actually fair premium is M equals P. That's the actually fair premium. is they charge you per dollar the odds that the accident happens. And that reduces the dimensionality of the program. So now using that assumption, let's assume utility is the square root form. We can rewrite our expected utility as 1 minus p times square root. We'll assume a square root function of w minus pb, because remember M is the same as P. We're just plugging in. W minus PB plus P times the square root of W minus PB minus delta plus B. Okay? That's the expected utility function you face in the actually fair insurance market. Oh, shit, I forgot. Mike. Sorry. Okay, so that's the, that's the, that's the expect utility function with actual insurance. Okay, so now our goal is to simply maximize this utility. Any questions about that? Hopefully that this is a 1401 review, but it's fine to ask questions if it's not, because this is like the fundamental thing we'll do for the next six lectures. So please ask questions. Okay. Well, if we basically maximize this utility function, what are we going to get? I'm going to go through the steps and appendix, but the standard maximization. What do you get? Well, at the end of the day, what you get is that you want to choose an optimal level of insurance, B star, which is equal to delta. You can see that here. Because what is your goal? It's to smooth consumption. Your goal here is to have the same consumption level regardless of if you get it by the car. There's no benefit to you consuming more if you don't get it by the car if it means consuming less if you do get it by the car. Well, that happens when you plug in delta for B. Okay? So basically, the bottom line is that you want the same level of consumption in both states. So that's going to say the optimal benefit level is going to be you basically want to fully insure yourself. You want to buy insurance to cover the full cost of the accident. And that's the key conclusion. And I urge you, if you go in the textbook for the students not as smart as you here at MIT, I do this in sort of a mathematical example, not with the formulas. You should review it in the textbook. That will help you understand the intuition if you don't get it already. But the key intuition is that basically, the key bottom line is that basically you want full insurance. and full insurance means uh buying insurance policy that covers the entire wow what the hell do i do here let's try that So full insurance means buying the policy that covers the entire amount that's at risk if you get hit by the car. That is what people would like. That's my benchmark for the next six lectures, is going to be this. This is where people want to be. So the question is, why can't the private market just get them there? And the answer is because there are various failures in the market for insurance that get in the way of getting there. And the primary failure is the problem of asymmetric information, which leads to adverse selection. Adverse selection, which really arises from the problem of asymmetric information. The classic example here is, once again, sorry for the Fortune 01, those who took it from me, is the Akroloff-Lemons model. The Akroloff-Lemons model is basically the idea that, look, let's say I want to sell my car. And let's say I am happy to take $5,000 for my car. I'm happy to accept $5,000 for my car. You come in, and this is 30 years ago before Carfax. You come in, and you would love have a car like mine, you'd be happy to pay $6,000 for a car like mine. I would take $5,000, you would have to pay $6,000. That's a trade that is welfare improvement. But there's a risk that my car sucks, and you'll have to put in $2,000 of repairs. Well, you might say, given that risk, I don't want to buy the car. If I think that risk is greater than 50%, or even less than 50% from risk averse, I don't want to buy the car. Now, I can say to you, I swear to God, my car is fine. And let's say my car is fine. But since I can't prove it to you, you don't buy my car. So the asymmetrization, the fact that I have more information than you, leads you to be concerned I'm cheating you and selling you a bad car. And so a transaction to make both parties better off doesn't get made. Thus was born the term lemons. You know, in Massachusetts, we have a lemon law, which is you can return your car within 30 days, things like that. The idea of a bad car is a lemon. Come from that. Okay? So in the used car market, the problem is that the seller – has more information than the buyer. In insurance markets, the problem is the opposite. The problem in insurance markets is that the buyer has more information than the seller. The buyer, in particular, knows their underlying health. They know if they like to ride a motorcycle at excessive speed. I just got back from riding horses as fast as possible across the plains of Mexico. I presume my insurer, when they insured me, did not know that and probably would have liked to know that that's something I like to do. Okay. So they might know about, I would know about all these various things that I might do that might risk my health. Okay. And basically they don't. And so they're worried that basically they're going to end up losing money. So let's work through the mathematics of how that arises. Okay. Once again, the sort of intuitions in the book, let's go through the math, which is in the appendix. Okay. So imagine that we're in a world, the same world of expect utility, but imagine now there's two groups, careful and accident prone. Okay. So let's say there's two groups, careful and accident prone. Okay. So basically for the careful people, Hannah Carter, can you basically send me a rhyme? There's a typo in the book on page 347. It should be P sub C, not PC. So let's assume there's two probability of getting hit by a car for the accident prone is greater than the probability for the careful. Now, imagine that otherwise the model is the same. Well, in this case, if insurers could know, if you walked in and insurers knew what type you were, we would simply solve this model twice. If you walked in and said, hey, you're a professor, So that means you're careless. I'm going to chart. I'll just solve this model with P sub C. Or if I walk in and say, or a P sub A, if you walk in and you're like, you're careful, they'll solve with P sub C. And they just charge two different prices. They charge a higher price per dollar of insurance to the accident prone than the careful. And everybody's happy. Insurers break even because they're still charging M equals P. It's just now it's PA or PC. And people are still choosing B star equals D. They're choosing optimally. So it's no problem. The problem arises where I don't know what type you are, where I can't tell by your job or something else I can tell by looking for you, whether you're accident prone or careful. In that case, the problem is that I might be in trouble. So let's imagine, for example, the insurer says, look, I can tell what type you are, but I'm just going to offer our insurance at the average. I'll just say that basically, actually, no, let me start with a simple thing. Let me start by assuming people are honest. I'll assume people are honest, and I'll charge them whatever premium. I'm going to ask them when they come in, are you accident prone or careless? I'll charge the appropriate premium. Well, in that case, on the careful folks, they'll come in, they'll say they're careful. The insurer will charge them P sub C, and the insurer will break even and they'll get all the insurance they want. But the accident prone folks will lie. They will come and say they're also careful. the insurer will charge the P sub C and the insurer will lose money. Why will the insurer lose money? Because the insurer's expected profits, expected profits on, on the, on the, they'll charge a piece of a, I'm sorry. The insurer's expected profits on the accident prone folks are, they're going to, they're going to basically charge them a premium M sub C, which is the premium that they charge the careful folks. But they're going to pay out B times P sub A. Or they're going to charge them B times P sub C. And they're going to pay out B times P sub A. So the insurer is going to lose money. Because P sub A is bigger than P C, their profits will be negative. So the insurer will lose money. now the insurers are not stupid they understand that and they could just say fine i understand that some people are risky and some people aren't so i'm just going to charge the average premium that way i'll average it out let's say that it turns out in reality as many people let's say that um half the people are a and half the people are c let's say we know that for a fact so insurers could just say fine i will just charge the average premium okay let's call that um piece of v okay let's call that piece of v okay well if they charge the average premium and everyone buys then they'll make zero profits again because everyone will buy and they'll be charging the average premium. But in fact, what will happen if you charge the average premium? If you charge a premium below, if you charge a premium above the premium for the careful and below the premium for the accident prone, how many of the accident prone will buy? Charge a premium above the premium for the careful, below the premium for the accident prone, how many of the accident prone will buy? yeah all of them because it's a good deal because you're charging below their actually fair level and how many of the careful will buy well it's we're still in a few minutes it depends but certainly not all of them okay as long as not as long as more of the accident prone buy than the careful buy you will lose money because you're charging the average which is assuming that you're getting an equal mix of the two. But in fact, you're not getting equal mix of the two. Okay. You're basically getting, you're basically getting, you're getting a bias mix and therefore you will lose. You'll basically, you'll lose money on the absent mind and you won't have enough careful people to make it up in the extreme. Imagine none of the careful bought. You can see why you'd lose money. You're charging the average. but you have a risk at the higher level. Okay? Questions about that? It's very important to understand. So don't feel ashamed, embarrassed to ask questions about this. Okay. Now, I heard a couple people say none of the careful would buy. That's not necessarily true. In fact, it's possible that all of the careful would still buy. Why? Why could you have a situation where I charge the average price? We know all the absent-minded would buy. It's a great deal. Why might all the careful buy two? Risk aversion. Because if I'm risk averse enough, remember, risk averse individuals are willing to pay a risk premium for insurance. Listen, 1401 again. If you're risk averse, insurance is worth more to you than it costs, than an actually fair premium. Insurance is worth more to you than actually fair premium. As a result, individuals are risk averse. So in other words, let's think about the case faced by the careful person. And let's imagine that the insurance company is charging a premium P sub V, which is the average premium. I don't know why I chose V. P sub V is the average premium. Okay. What is the decision faced by the careful person? Well, if they buy insurance, their expected utility, so if they buy, their expected utility equals one minus PC, because they're careful, times the utility of W minus PV times delta, because that's the premiums they pay. They pay PV. Okay. Plus PC, plus PC times the same thing, W minus PV delta, because if they buy full insurance, okay that's that's what they'll get if they buy full insurance basically their expect utility is going to be utility of w minus pv delta okay that's that's their insurance that's their expect utility if they buy insurance if they don't buy insurance If they don't buy insurance, their expected utility is equal to 1 minus PC times U of W plus PC times U of W minus delta. Okay? So if they buy insurance, they've consumption smoothed. And so the utility is always W minus PV sine delta, no matter what happens. If they don't buy insurance, their utility varies whether they get in the accident or not. You can't tell ex ante if one of you is greater than the other. It depends on the level of risk aversion. If you're very risk averse, it is possible that there's enough curvature in utility function where this is such a bad outcome. Think about log utility. And think about a delta equals W. with log utility and delta equals W, what's this term? Negative infinity. So by definition, you're always better off buying insurance. Okay. With log utility and delta equals W, this inequality will always hold. You'll always be better off buying insurance than not buying insurance because negative infinity is zero is so awful. Okay. Now, if utility was linear, that wouldn't be true. But it's because your risk ratio is nonlinear that you have this situation. So the bottom line is if insurers charge an average price, you may or may not get back to the equilibrium of full insurance. We call this a pooling equilibrium. A cooling equilibrium is where you can charge the average price and everyone buys. And that will happen if people are sufficiently risk averse. But if they are not sufficiently risk averse and you try to charge the average price, not everyone will buy and you'll lose money. So here's another way to think about it. Here's the right way to think from insurance theory principles. The efficient outcome, as we proved here, the efficient outcome is full insurance. Market efficiency is achieved when every individual is fully insured. That might happen here, but it might not. OK, if it doesn't happen. That's what we call the problem of adverse selection. Adverse selection is where the fact that you're charging one price, but there's two types of people, leads the market to collapse. Leads the market to not want to provide insurance. Not collapse, but leads to less than, well, in this case, leads the market to collapse. The fact that you're charging one price for the two types of people means insurers lose money. okay as i said here in this example insurers lose money here they're going to lose money charging the average too so basically the fact there's asymmetric information the fact that basically people only buy if it's in their self-interest can lead to an inefficiency and that's the market failure government's trying to solve that's the adverse selection that's the adverse selection problem that government's trying to solve Okay. Okay. Now, questions about that? Now, it turns out there is another equilibrium we can achieve where the market doesn't collapse, and yet an adverse selection doesn't destroy the market, but it does affect the market. Because think about what gives rise to adverse selection. It's a problem that you're trying to charge one price for two different products. Well, it's an easy way to solve that, which is charge two prices for two different products. Imagine you could say, well, look, I don't know what type you are, but I'm going to charge it. If I don't know what type you are, I can't charge two prices because I'll just lie and say I want the lower price. But what if I try to sell two? What if I sell two different products? In particular, what if I offer one skimpy insurance product and one generous insurance product? What if I offer one product that's full coverage and one product that's, say, half coverage? It's possible that you can work it out, that in that case, people reveal themselves. The sick people will go ahead and buy the full coverage product, but they won't want the half coverage product. The healthy will go ahead and buy the half coverage product, but they won't want the full coverage product because it's too expensive. So you'll end up with an equilibrium where sick people pay a lot of money for a full coverage product and healthy people pay less money for a partial coverage product. So what have you done? The problem with adverse selection is you try to charge one price for two essentially different products. What you do is you then charge two prices for two explicitly different products, a good insurance plan and a shitty insurance plan. The sick guy never wants a shitty insurance plan because it leaves him too close to disaster. but the healthy guy might not mind the insurance plan because the odds he gets sick are so rare that he might not mind. Okay. So that is what we call a separating equilibrium. A separating equilibrium is where you get equilibrium, but you charge two different prices for two different products. One of which is full coverage. One of which is less than full coverage and you get equilibrium, everybody buys insurance. Is that efficient? Is it an efficient equilibrium? Is it the same as say the pooling equilibrium? Shaking your head, why not? Go ahead. Because it's not full insurance. Efficiency requires full insurance and in the separate equilibrium, some people are not getting full insurance. The healthy people are buying skimpy insurance and that's not optimal. Optimal insurance is full insurance. This is a very, very important point. The sacral equilibrium is an equilibrium. Everybody's getting insured, but only the sick people get what we really want them to have, which is full insurance. The healthy will get less than full insurance. So it's not an efficient equilibrium. So the bottom line is, if you sort of think about the taxonomy of insurance, first best efficient market is everyone has full insurance. With full information, we can get there. with imperfect information, we only get there under certain conditions, under this pooling condition. This is the pooling condition. Only under the pooling condition do we get there. If we don't meet the pooling condition, one of two things can happen. One is the market can collapse totally. The other is we can get a separating equilibrium where the market doesn't collapse, but the healthy will end up with skimpy insurance. Questions about that? Now, lest you think this is a theoretical example, let's talk about what happened to this lesser institution down the street known as Harvard. Let's talk about what happened to insurance at Harvard. Basically, the way insurance is priced to employers, to a large employer, is typically through what's called experience rating. An experience rated policy is one where basically the price I charge you for insurance is X post reflects how much people spent. So large enough pool like Harvard University or MIT, basically your bill next year is essentially what you spent this year. You're essentially self-insured. They essentially say we're going to bill you what you paid this year, in aggregate. Now, basically, the way Harvard used to work, Harvard offered a series of options to its employees of health insurance plans. Some of them were more generous, and some were less generous. And the way Harvard did it was it essentially said, look, we're going to pay 80% of the cost of your plan. what that meant was effectively harvard was subsidizing the generous plan relative to less generous plan because it's paying 80 of each so you ended up in an initial equilibrium where some healthy people bought the most generous plan even though it was expensive it wasn't that expensive because harvard picked up 80 of the costs see initial equilibrium where mostly the most expensive plan was more sick people but some healthy people bought it too and you're in equilibrium. Then Harvard changed its system. It said, now we're going to have a different system, what's called the defined contribution system, where Harvard's going to pay a fixed amount equal to the cost of the least generous plan. And if you want to buy more, you have to pay it out of your pocket. So if you want to buy a more generous plan, you bear 100% of the cost of that more generous plan. Previously, you bore 20% of the cost. Now you bear 100% of the cost. What happened is all the health people said, wait a second. If I have to pay all the costs, I don't want the most generous plan, but I'm fine with the skimpy plan. So they left the most generous plan. So with experience rating, what does that do to the premium of the most expensive plan? If healthy will leave and sick people are left, and the premium you charge for a plan is the average cost of people in it, what happens to the premium? It goes up because the sick people are left. What goes up? What does that do to the healthy people who are left? They say, well, screw that. I'm leaving. They leave. What does that do to the premium? It goes up. Healthy people leave. It goes up. Eventually, you end up with what we call a death spiral, which is basically, at the end of the day, the program collapses. Because every year it gets more expensive, people leave. And at the end of the day, it collapses. That is a market failure. Why is it a market failure if a certain plan that was in demand collapses because of adverse selection? Why is that a market failure? What's the inefficiency? What's the inefficiency of this outcome? They had this expensive plan people liked. It eventually collapsed because freemasons got too high. People ended up in different plans. Why is that inefficient? What's the definition of inefficiency? It's trades that people want to make that don't get made. We had a trade people want to make. They wanted that most expensive plan. And they were to make it in the subsidized equilibrium. But once you allowed the prospects of imperfect information to play out by removing that subsidy, you destroyed an option that was valued by people. That's inefficient. Because the fact people chose it meant it was valued. So basically, what you're doing is you are creating an efficiency by removing an option that people clearly liked, but the prospect of adverse selection kind of destroyed. By the way, not to brag at Harvard too much, same thing happened at MIT. We ended up with a plan with two people left in it, and the university just bought them out. So basically, this is the prospects of adverse selection. So governments, so in that case, the private market, adverse selection, unless you meet this particular condition for pooling equilibrium, adverse selection will lead to inefficiencies and insurance markets. And governments can come along and remedy that. They can offer subsidies as Harvard did. They can mandate people participate, which gets us back to the pooling equilibrium. There's lots of things governments can do, and we'll talk about them, to get back to a pooling equilibrium that works. Or they could just provide insurance. There's lots of ways to do it. Questions about that? Yeah. It's going to be like a hand-wavy question, but like how do people- It's okay. It's a hand-wavy course. How do people decide to buy insurance before like a mandate for subsidies? Like given the conditions, do they kind of, do they sit down and do it or do they just kind of like- Oh, you mean how do people actually in reality do it? Oh, we don't care about that in economics. No. That's what I spent a lot of my career studying and they do it very badly. It's the answer. So my research shows that if you look at people choosing insurance plans and you kind of ex post evaluate how they do, about 15% of people choose the best insurance plan for them out of the set of options they have. So basically, it's an incredibly complicated decision. It's an incredibly complicated decision because insurance isn't this easy. Insurance features a lot of, has a lot of different features that are complicated to evaluate. Like some insurance plans cover some drugs on one cost. Some insurance plans cover other drugs on different costs. Some insurance plans have a deductible, which is you pay up to $2,000. Others have a copay, which you pay $50 every time you go. It's very hard to evaluate. And in fact, people do a pretty terrible job choosing. Okay. In fact, here's an amazing fact, probably not true now, but when the paper was written, that's about five years ago, somebody took all employer plans and asked, can you find examples of plans that are dominated? What would a dominated plan look like? A dominated plan would be one where no matter how sick you get, it's still better to have that plan than another plan. Like for example, imagine a plan that has a $5,000 out-of-pocket maximum. Most pay is $5,000, but the premium savings is more than 5,000 a year. Okay. Then that's a better plan. 50% of employers in America offer dominated options in their insurance plans. 50%. Okay. So clearly people don't do such a good job and people choose them. So clearly there's some problems and that's something we'll come back to in like three lectures and talk about that in the context of public insurance. Now, adverse selection is not the only reason governments need to intervene in insurance markets. Insurance markets are broken in a lot of ways. We talked about another reason governments need to intervene, which is externalities. We talked about externalities. The classic case, adverse selection is sort of a pretty complicated case for government intervention. The simple case we covered in the first lecture is just externalities. Externalities can be physical, which is basically, I get you sick by not being insured, or they can be fiscal, which is that the US spends something like $50, $35 billion a year in uncompensated care. By not being insured, I go to the hospital that cared for free, and that gets passed on to the insured and higher bills. That's an externality. That's a classic argument for government's intervening. Another classic argument is administrative costs. So it turns out many of the costs of administering insurance are fixed. As a result, the larger the pool of insurance, the lower the administrative costs, the share of premiums. So for example, the typical private insurer in America has administrative costs, which include profits, of about 15% of the premium. That is every dollar we pay in insurance premiums, only about 85 cents goes to reimburse our medical care. For the government Medicare program, that number is 2%. Okay. So there's an administrative argument for government, which is just basically by the government creating larger pools, they create administrative efficiency that we lose with the private sector. Okay. This matters, by the way. This is not a trivial issue. Because remember what assumption I made in this model. I assumed actually fair insurance. You can prove to yourself that if insurance is not actually fair, if M is greater than P, then people will no longer demand full insurance. If M is greater than P, then people won't buy full insurance. That's inefficient. So lack administrative costs can lead to insurance inefficiency. This isn't just a sort of annoying accounting fact. This is a real fact for thinking about optimal insurance. Okay. A third factor is redistribution. It's another reason that governments might want to get involved in insurance markets. Okay. It may be that governments want to make sure, the governments think that it's low-income people who really suffer the most that want to help them. Yeah. How much confidence do you have that people are fully aware of the insurance they have? Well, it's just the zero confidence. Yeah, that's exactly my point. People don't know. You're sort of asking the ex-post version of her ex-ante question. She was saying how well do people do choosing it? Badly. How well do they understand what they have? Terrible. Yeah, same thing. Yeah. So basically, here's an interesting feature about redistribution that is sort of a subtle point but is important. technologies that make insurance that very technologies that reduce the information problem make the redistribution problem worse so for example the more think about genetic testing the more i can tell how sick you're going to be through genetic testing at birth the less information asymmetry there is right and the more fucked you are if you're sick okay so basically as we get better and better genetic testing the information asymmetry problem will go away. The adverse selection problem will go away. But the new problem will be that people who are sick just can't get insurance. And we don't like that necessarily as an outcome, too. So that's another argument for government intervention. And then finally, we have probably the most important argument politically, which is just plain old paternalism, which is we just don't think people understand or think through the consequence of not having full insurance, especially the so-called young invincibles, which is you all. We think that people don't realize that they're in Cambridge, there's a 17% chance to get hit by a car on any given day. That's only slightly overstated. And that it's valuable to have insurance. So that's the last sort of argument. So there's lots of reasons why governments might want to offer insurance. One important reason I discuss at length in the book is sort of a related version of these reasons, which is called the Samaritan's Dilemma. It's the famous, I don't know where it came from, Samaritan's Dilemma, which is basically the point that if the government ex post is going to end up paying your bills anyway, ex ante, it might want to make sure you have insurance. The Samaritan's Dilemma refers to an ancient proverb or whatever the hell it is about the guy who somebody gets hurt in the road, he helps them and he ends up you know, ends up kind of spending all his money helping people when he just kind of, you know, people, if they've been able to help themselves, would have been fine. And the actual, so more modern parallel is the birth of the modern pension. As apocryphal stories will have it, the birth of the modern pension program came out of what happened to, in universities. What happened would be professors would not save enough to make sure, professors who were all male back in the old days, would not make enough to ensure that their wives could live after they died. And typically women live longer than men. So the wives would come back to the university saying, hey, my husband worked for you for all these years and now I'm broke. Universities would bail them out. You're just saying, wait a second, we should force the professors to save for themselves and their spouses so that we don't have to end up bailing them out at the end. And so Samaritan's dilemma is the idea that we want to force people to have insurance because we can't resist helping them when they need help anyway. so the best example of this is the argument for flood insurance okay if when there's floods we end up help people out anyway we end up setting all this money to flood zones to help people out that would argue that there's a good argument for trying to make sure people have flood insurance in the first place so we don't just go and bail them out after uh after the flood there's a big discussion of that uh in the book this is particularly true because if you don't, if you bail people out afterwards, as opposed to making the insurance for land, you encourage bad behavioral. Come to talk about moral hazard. But the way we've set up our system now, which is bailing people out if they get flooded, encourages them to build in floodplains because the house gets flooded, they just get the money back. If we force them to buy insurance, which was fairly priced, that would make people realize that building in a floodplain was particularly expensive and that would deter people from doing what they shouldn't do, which is building in floodplains. So that is the Samaritan's dilemma argument for why we want to sort of mandate insurance as we do with flood insurance in the US. And there's some fun examples of that and some discussion of that in the book. Questions about that? Now, what we're going to do in the last half hour here is we're going to lay out the fundamental trade-off that comes with setting up social insurance programs. And the fundamental trade-off is going to have two sides. It's going to be the benefits of consumption smoothing against the costs of moral hazard. So I'm going to cover each of those now. So the first is the benefits of consumption smoothing. this is the benefits of social insurance. Once again, this is just a way to restate, but putting a different framework, the point we just made, which is people want full insurance. Absent government intervention, insurance markets will fail and they won't get it. But there's a subtlety here that is important to keep in mind because what I've made the argument so far is a one-zero argument. Yes, government should be involved in providing insurance. I haven't gotten into how much, and that's what's been the last half hour on here, which is not should the government intervene? Yes, they should. The answer is how much should they intervene? And that will depend on evaluating this fundamental trade-off between the benefits of intervening, which is you help people smooth their consumption, and the cost of intervening, which is you encourage bad behavior or moral hazard. Now, how do we measure the benefits of insurance? Well, you might say, well, it's easy. You just look at how sad people would be without insurance. We know what they'd be without insurance. They would basically have this utility function. They have utility function without insurance, they'd be W minus delta. And that's how sad you of W minus delta. But that's not quite true because that misses an important subtlety in the real world, which is when adverse events happen to people, they often have some forms of self-insurance. This is kind of the flip side. It's related to the crowd out discussion we had in Chapter 7. In Chapter 7, we said when the government comes in to provide public goods, some of what it will do is crowd out private provision already happening. The same thing is true with adverse events, which is some people have other ways to pay their bills when adverse things happen, and the government might just crowd them out. So for example, let's take unemployment insurance. Let's say you're at risk of losing your job. How could you handle that? What are mechanisms people could use on their own to deal with the fact they lose income by losing their job? What could they do? Raise your hands. They could have savings. They could draw on savings. What else? Yeah. Solid point of rest and higher wage. Well, that would be an ex-ante preparation. But when they actually lose their job, what could they do to smooth their consumption? What could they do? And they've lost their job. How could they smooth their consumption? We could say they could save money from higher wages. What else could they do? Yeah. They could borrow. They could borrow from the bank. They could borrow from their friends. They could borrow from their parents. They could get gifts. other people in their family can go to work, family labor supply, et cetera. Okay. In other words, the point is the person becomes unemployed is not just curled up in a fetal ball with nothing to do. Okay. They have things they can do to help smooth their consumption. And we label these things self-insurance. Okay. Here's the best example that I always teach in this class, a true example, which is that my wife's aunt, when she worked, worked for the Toro factory. If you guys heard Toro, they make lawnmowers and snowblowers and stuff like that. Their biggest factory is in Windham, Minnesota, where my wife's family's from. And she worked there. And every summer, the Toro factory closed because that was their low season. And they didn't need to produce in the summer. And they didn't want to pay their workers. So they closed for three months in the summer. During those three months, she did not get paid. During those three months, she then went on and became the state champion softball pitcher of Minnesota. But because she wasn't working, she could apply for unemployment insurance. So she received unemployment insurance. Now, imagine what would happen if my aunt didn't get unemployment insurance and she was rational. What would she have done? Well, she'd done what all professors do. We only get paid over nine months. She'd save from the nine months and put it towards the other three months. So in that world, what is unemployment insurance doing? It's simply crowding out her savings. She already had an optimal plan, which was consume somewhat less while working and spread it towards the summer when she wasn't working. Unemployment insurance would say, great, I'll consume more while working because I don't have to save as much for the summer. So it would literally just crowd out the savings she was going to do anyway. In that case, it isn't doing any consumption smoothing. So if you're perfectly self-insured in a world where you're perfectly self-insured, then insurance doesn't do anything for you. Government insurance doesn't do anything for you. So government insurance is only a benefit to the extent that you can't self-insure against problems. It's only bad to the extent you can't self-insure against those same shocks. Yeah. I just, like, when the professors, like, not working this time. No, actually, we get paid over 12 months. But in the old days, you only got paid over nine months, and you could not, you weren't laid off, so you couldn't collect it. We're not laid off, so you have to be laid off. I'll come to that next lecture. That'd be quite the ripoff. So basically, if you think, so basically the point is, the point I want to make is the better is people's self-insurance. the less valuable is government-provided insurance. Okay, the better is people's self-insurance, the more government-provided insurance will simply crowd it out and not add value. Just like in the case of Ben and Jerry, the government fireworks didn't increase the total number of fireworks at all. It just crowded out Ben and Jerry's spending. If people can perfectly self-insure, then government insurance will just simply crowd out that self-insurance. It won't increase consumption slowly. So basically, to understand how big the consumption smoothing is from insurance, we need to ask, how good is self-insurance? Well, what will determine that? When will self-insurance likely be strong, and when will it likely be weak? Under what kinds of situations, or example situations, do we think self-insurance is likely to be strong? We think we probably don't need other insurance? Under what types of situations? When do we think it's super unlikely that people will be self-insured? When do we think we definitely would need government insurance? Yeah. When people live paycheck to paycheck as opposed to having a large amount of income they can just save? Right. If they live paycheck. So basically, we think self-insurance might be more valuable when people are more cash-constrained and they can't borrow when they face liquidity constraints. What else? Yeah. Yeah. The less predictable, the less self-insured you'll be. Okay. I am not saving for an asteroid hitting earth, especially now that they deflected that one. Okay. I'm not saving an asteroid hitting earth. So it seems like you should insure me against an asteroid hitting earth because that's not something I'm very well self-insured against. Okay. So the less predictable the event, the less likely you are to be self-insured against it. What else? And it's related to the point that was made about income. The larger the event, the less likely to be self-insured against it. So basically, if you think about something that's an incredibly unlikely, very large event, like an asteroid hitting Earth, there's no way people are self-insured against that. If you think about something that's not so big and fully predictable, like my wife's aunt losing a quarter of her income every year, that's pretty big, but it's totally predictable. Then self-insurance is likely to be pretty good and you don't really, because social insurance won't add that much value. So basically the value added of social insurance is the compliment of how good self-insurance is. The better is self-insurance. So just once again, I'll show you one more time. The better is self-insurance, that is the more events are predictable and low stakes, the more social insurance will just crowd out other forms of self-insurance and the less consumption smoothing you'll get from it. The worse is self-insurance, that is things that are unpredictable and large stakes, the more you won't have much self-insurance and social insurance will do a lot of consumption smoothing. Questions about that? So that is the first side of the fundamental trade-off of social insurance. The second side is the problem of moral hazard. Okay. Let's do this. The second side is the problem of moral hazard. Okay. moral hazard dates all the way back at least to shakespeare who wrote in act three scene five of timon of athens nothing emboldened sin so much as mercy which is basically shakespeare's fancy ass way of saying the more you protect people against bad things happening the more bad things will happen to you okay so basically what this means is there is a concern that the more government insures you against adverse events, the less you will be careful to protect yourself against those adverse events. The best way to illustrate this is with the workers' compensation program, workers' comp. Workers' comp, and once again, just like unemployment insurance, we'll talk more about these programs, talk more about this program in two lectures. But it's basically a program where if you get hurt on the job, the government comes in and pays for your medical care and your lost wages. It's actually not the government. It's actually government mandated insurance. But think of it as the government coming in and doing it. So basically, the idea is that essentially, the government comes in and says, if you're hurt on the job, we'll pay for your medical care and we'll replace all your wages. Well, what does that do to someone's incentives? Well, remember, leisure is a normal good. I would rather be not working. That's sort of realized. Remember, it's hard model to teach at MIT, but most people in the world actually don't want to work. Okay. I'd rather be not working. Leisure is a normal good. Okay. So if the government comes in and says you can earn the same thing not working as working, that's a pretty strong incentive to find a way to claim workers' comp. Okay. Now you might say, well, you can't because it's about getting hurt at work. Well, you'd be wrong because it turns out you can fake getting hurt at work. as some fun examples in the book example. So for example, any of you guys ever hear of Wicked Tuna TV show? It's got a gloss drop where I live sometimes. There was this guy, there's a third generation tuna fisherman named Paul Hebert, who filed for disability, claiming he couldn't work at his job, did a physical disability and he had no financial resources. So the government was helping him because he couldn't do his job anymore. He then went on and starred in the show Wicked Tuna, which showed him out fishing, reeling and spearing tuna and lifting up from the boat over his head and going, yay, I've got this. While he's collecting checks from the government saying he couldn't work. That's moral hazard. There was the guy who basically claimed he had a worker's comp injury to his ankle and couldn't walk, so he couldn't work. And they caught him that the fact was, while he was not at work, he was operating as a tandem skydiving instructor, which kind of involves your ankles when you land. But probably my favorite example is, my favorite example is, and of course it happened in, Florida. Okay. My favorite example was a woman was working in Fort Lauderdale when she noticed a sprinkler falling from the ceiling and landed on her desk. Okay. So she picked it up, looked around, hit herself in the head with it and claimed workers comp, which was fine until they found out there was a video of the whole thing, which is how we know she did that. And she got busted. The bottom line is, if there's incentive to behave badly, then on the margins, somebody will behave badly, okay, or at least not protect themselves in terms of bad actions. So if we think about moral hazard, when is moral hazard going to be the worst? When is moral hazard going to be the least? What is going to determine the conditions where moral hazard is least or or back or most severe or least severe do you tell me what are the conditions where you'd most worry about moral hazard and the condition where you least worry about moral hazard not gonna you know examples general principles whatever yeah yeah if it's a really severe injury you probably it's you probably aren't gonna like you know cut off your arm or blind yourself okay what else yeah What's that? Yeah, basically how observable it is. Not just supervision, but in general of how observable it is. If it's something where basically, it's basically, if you can really observe whether an adverse event happens, there's unlikely to be adverse selection. Everything's filmed. I read this pretty cool book by this guy, Ben Winters, called Golden State, about a future of California where everything at all times is filmed. or there's no fiction anymore. And basically everything's filmed at all times. There's no moral hazard because you can always see. So basically, if things are very observable and if things are very severe, there's unlikely moral hazard. But A, severe to one man is severe not to another man, as illustrated by the case in the 1950s and 60s when the city of Vernon in Florida gained renown when investigators noticed that more than two-thirds of, I have a hard time reading this, more than two-thirds of all loss of limb accident claims in the U.S. came from one city. And it turned out a group of individuals had decided the personal cost of losing a limb was less than the benefit of the insurance money they could collect. As a result, people were sawing and cutting off their own arms and legs, Philip Insurance Party. It then became known as nub city. So moral hazard, or probably one of my favorite examples, you can see this online, you can Google it, Google Bugatti into the ocean. Bugatti is a very expensive car, super expensive car. This guy bought a Bugatti and somehow managed to insure it for a lot of money, more than he actually paid for it. And then he went back to the insurance company and said, look, I was driving on the coast of, and a seagull flew into my windshield and I had to steer because it threw me off. I steered into the ocean. The car goes astray. I want my insurance money. What's awesome is he didn't realize there's a parallel road. And so it was thick. His car was so cool. So I was filming it. It's this awesome film with these guys like, yo dude, check out that awesome car. Holy shit. That car's like, holy fuck. He just drove into the ocean. Why'd he do that? And the video shows there was no seagull. He just drove into the ocean. So basically it turns out things might be observable when you don't think they are, and they might not be quite as severe as you think. So moral hazard is a little bit tricky. Moral hazard is also importantly multidimensional. Importantly, we're going to talk about in this class four dimensions of moral hazard. The first dimension is the classic, what we call ex ante or reduced precaution. the classic example of moral hazard is because I have fire insurance, I don't buy a fire extinguisher. Because I have insurance against a bicycle crash, I don't ride my bike as safely. Because I have insurance against the flu, I don't wear a mask, et cetera. Basically, the idea is essentially since I'm insured against a bad thing, I don't have to protect myself against that bad thing. That's the classic sort of ex-ante type of moral hazard. When economists think of moral hazard, that's what they think of. Although in fact, that's probably the least consequential type of moral hazard in the real world. Okay. The second type of moral hazard is increased odds of adverse events. So basically the idea here is because I have workers' compensation, I am more likely to claim a workplace injury. It's not that I took less care beforehand. That's ex ante. It's because I have workers' compensation, I'm more likely to claim I'm hurt on the job. That's a second type of moral hazard. A third type of moral hazard is increased expenditures in the adverse state. in the adverse state. So for increased expenditures in the adverse state, geez, this is awful. Slightly better. Okay. Increased expenditures in the adverse state. The idea here is that basically once I've already claimed workers' comp, I might as well stay out of work as long as possible. Or if I've decided I want to go to the doctor, I got aches and pains, I might as well get that extra test while I'm there. Basically, the idea is not once you've decided to be in the Everstate, you might as well kind of max it out. You know, you might as well stay out of work as long as you can. You might as well get all the tests you can at the doctor, et cetera. Okay? So that is an – or, you know, if you're unemployed, you might as well stay unemployed as long as you can until your benefits run out. And then finally, the last type of moral hazard, which we really won't come to to talk about medical care, is supplier responses. is supplier side moral hazard, which is, gee, if people don't care, if people are insured for medical tests and I get paid for every medical test, I'll give them as many tests as I can. Right? If people don't care because they don't have to pay any money for medical tests and the insurance is going to pay me per medical test, God, you look like you'll need a lot of tests. Okay? And that's the supplier side of moral hazard. So we're going to come in this class, talk about all four of these we won't spend much on this because the on ex-ante because the extent turns out to be it's like a giffin goods one of the things economists love talking about that no one can find much evidence of but these are really the uh the major source of moral hazard we'll talk about okay questions about that yeah do you explain the difference between what we were first talking about and the second type of increased odds of adverse events yeah so the first one is um uh You're right. The labels and got any better. The first one is literally I'm less careful. Ex ante. But I don't try to cheat and claim I'm hurt if I'm not hurt. The second one, I try to cheat and claim I'm hurt if I'm not hurt. OK, so I need a better name for that. You're right. The second one is like, even if I'm not hurt, I try to claim I am. The first one is I'm an honest guy. I'm just not going to worry. I'm not I'm not going to watch where I go when I walk on the ladder or whatever. Does that make sense? Good question. Other questions? Yeah. Is there any kind of insurance that, like, if you prevent it and stuff, only, like, only pay you for primary care, only pay you for fire? That's exactly, we'll talk about that. We talk about optimal health insurance. That's exactly what, that's exactly the discussion we'll have. All right. Now, last point I want to make. Why do we care about moral hazard? Why do I care? So the guy takes a few weeks off from his job at the construction site. Why do I care? In economics terms. Yeah. Yeah, it's inefficient. Okay. And here's the way to think about it in a simple mathematical model terms. Okay. Optimal labor supply is such that with an efficient labor market, I will want to work until my wage equals the marginal value of leisure. We talked about that in Chapter 8. Right? It doesn't matter if I'm deterred from driving or driving to go play or driving to work. In a perfectly competitive labor market, I will work until those are equal. Well, what a program that subsidizes you to stay at home does is it changes the equation. Now, if you stay at home, if you work, you get your wage. But if you stay at home, what do you get? You get the marginal value of leisure plus a benefit. So it tips the balance. Now you will not work the optimal amount. You work less than the optimal amount because you get an extra benefit from staying at home. In other words, you only go back to work if your wage is above your marginal value of pleasure, which is inefficient. So you work as long as your wage is equal to your marginal value of pleasure. So the inefficiency, there's an efficiency cost from the fact that productive trades are not being made. In this case, productive trade is your labor. Productively, you'd be working. and you're not working. And therefore, that is an efficiency cost. There's a second cost, which is what? Covers a part of the course we haven't gotten to, but I think you should be able to guess what it is. What's the other cost from having these people claim workers' comp or other things when they're not really sick? Yeah. Like opportunity cost? Money could be used for something. Yeah, you got to pay for it, right? The government's got to pay for it. The government could use that money for actually educating kids or something we care about. OK, so basically, the first problem is the inefficiency of people not optimally choosing how to use their time. The second part is you have to raise the tax revenues to actually pay for these programs. And that is inefficiencies that we'll talk about in chapters 18 and on. OK, we've sort of treated money as if it's free in this course so far, but it turns out it's not. OK, it turns out it does. it turns out taxes have consequences, negative consequences. And so that's basically how we think about the concept of moral hazard. So now we put it all together. What I really love about this section of the course is, to my mind, it's more of a closed system in other parts of the course. I feel like we talk about optimal other things. It's sort of like, well, we sort of wave our hands a lot. Here we wave our hands slightly less. Because here we can actually sort of write down the mathematical trade-off. The mathematical trade-off is essentially optimal insurance such that the benefits of consumption smoothing on the margin, that the marginal benefits of consumption smoothing are equal to the marginal cost of moral hazard. That is, you want to insure people until the next dollar does as much good in terms of smoothing consumption as it does bad in terms of causing moral hazard. And that's it. It's actually pretty straightforward. So what does that mean? That means you need to go to this piece about consumption. That means that we can actually evaluate this in a simple formula. If you measure the consumption smoothing and you measure the moral hazard distortion, then you can tell if insurance is too generous or not. So for example, this will mean full government social insurance is almost never optimal. It's hard to imagine a world where you'd want to 100% insure people against things, unless you are certain that there's both no self-insurance and no moral hazard. So it's a pretty rare case like asteroid explosions. We'd really want 100% insurance. That's a pretty interesting conclusion, because we started the lecture by proving full insurance is optimal. We proved it in a model without moral hazard. In a model with moral hazard, full insurance will never be optimal, as long as moral hazard is greater than zero. Okay? So what this says is social insurance, the ultimate government insurance should never be fully complete. It should be partial. And how partial it is will depend on this trade-off between how much it's moving your consumption and how much it is, how much it's moving your consumption and how much it is creating moral hazard. Okay? Questions about that? All right. So why don't we stop there? We'll come back Wednesday and we'll cover chapter 13, which is social security. Remember, so problem set is due Friday. Midterm is the next Wednesday, Monday. Because the problem set is due Friday. Midterm is next Monday. The problem set, we'll cover through last week's stuff and what I covered today. Lots of office hours to go ask questions if you have them and then in section on friday there'll be some review for the there'll be some review for the midterm midterm will be in class uh next monday well basically what this says if you think there's more like yeah So, like i mean still drop it i still want to draw i don't want to like It wasn't a pleasant experience heading for it. And I didn't. Let's say there was one point. I don't want to do it later. The sum of this utility is zero and the sum of this is negative. On the other hand, okay. You want to smooth it out. So as you have more insurance, the more smooth it gets up until the optimal point is when there's the insurance equals the cost of the thing. Because then, like, half of these are done. If I completely spend them all. Because you don't, the days don't change. Because you'll get minus delta, but you'll get plus b. And so every extra dollar you put towards making these things more equal, it's just a little more equal. Yeah. because at that point it's always the same and then on the other hand people on this side also and so you want more smoothing but then there's a cost of like all the moral hazards and so as soon as like the benefits from smoothing out where the cost of the moral hazards i was like jesus christ if you're looking at like of like like usually like utility right well like it'll like look like this right yeah so like if you're like here every single day compared to like oh i'm never gonna get you um but that um like this well that influence you like and like this then like the average of these two might be like here like this one is like always here so that's like the trade-off you want to make because like you're basically training like variance for like value right like if you like are always up here right then like on average like you're going to be able to have utilities i'm actually like dying but then or you could just like always be like because i'm always going to think about what it is so like because like this distance would be like how much you have to pay for insurance i don't understand but you can't have both so that's sign both okay oh because you you have this amount of money and you're up here right right i guess what so it's okay right so you're going to be like right you're here right and you're going to pay like some amount of insurance to move you here right why would you want your insurance because if you like you get into an accident oh yeah yeah yeah and so you're always going to be here every single day versus like 50 percent of the time you're here and so the average utility is like here right okay but why is that okay so so then So what are you arguing now? I just want to ask the bigger... I was just like, right? So like, and the thing is like, the reason why this happens is because of like, the decreasing marginal utility, right? Because like, when you're up here, it's like pretty flat, right? But then like, when something like really big happens, it pushes you all the way down here and you're like, oh, this is good. So you want to avoid that and just like, you're like trading this like small amount to like avoid going all the way down. Yeah. I don't know. I think Gloria and me might have different perspectives on job things, but also I'm not the job offer person because I don't have job offers. No, you're not. I also didn't have job offers. no you're uh you don't have to agonize over it I feel like the summer I would regret. If I end up going to sleep in a little bit this summer and I don't absolutely love it, then my options are a lot smaller. You never know. I think there's always a chance. Thank you. Thank you.
